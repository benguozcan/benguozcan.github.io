        I have been working as a professional software engineer since 2016.
        During this time, I mainly played a role in the development and
        maintenance of B2B products. In the scrum teams I was in, my
        responsibility was mostly the development of backend services, but I
        also fulfilled the responsibilities related to the frontend when
        necessary. Developed applications include payment gateway, e-wallet,
        invoice management, fund management, portfolio planning management.

        <br />
        <br />
        I consider global standards and best practices while developing. Backend
        service developments, architectural designs and platform-independent
        applications excite me.
